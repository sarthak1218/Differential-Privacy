# Differential-Privacy
# This project explores the application of differential privacy, a privacy-preserving technique commonly used to protect sensitive data in various fields, including geospatial crime data. The project focuses on implementing differential privacy through the **Laplace mechanism** to add noise to sensitive data, in this case, crime location coordinates (latitude and longitude). This ensures that while the data remains useful for analysis, individual privacy is safeguarded.  The dataset used consists of crime records from Los Angeles, and differential privacy is applied to obscure specific locations while maintaining overall trends and patterns. This project includes a thorough analysis of the effects of differential privacy on data utility through various methods such as **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **Correlation Analysis**, and **Cluster Analysis**.  The project compares the original data with the differentially private data to assess how well privacy is maintained while preserving the dataset's overall structure.
